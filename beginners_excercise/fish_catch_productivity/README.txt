This is a pystan linear model of fish catch data from the SeaAroundUs data and ten year mean NPP.
The NPP data is a mean on 110km2 grids (for the main research project).

Fish catch data was divided by the area of the Large Marine Ecosystems (LME) (http://www.lme.noaa.gov/) 
to yield tons per square kilometer.

The ten year mean NPP was summed for each LME and then divided by the total area. This yields NPP per
square kilometer.
